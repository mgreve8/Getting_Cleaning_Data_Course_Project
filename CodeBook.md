Code Book
  This will describe the variables in the data set "clean_samsung_data.txt" and the methods to get to this clean data set
  
Transformations or Work Performed
  The script run_analysis.R first will read the .zip file in from the website (see Readme.md file) and will then begin to merge
  the data based on subject, activity, and features. It then creates names for all the variables using the features and subject names.
  Once the files are merged using rbind and cbind, we then only want the mean and standard deviations for each measurement, so using 
  grep, the characters representing "mean" and "std" are extracted and put into a new data set using a subsetting function. 
  
  Once the data is subsetted, the data is now given descriptive variable names according to the activity performed. 
  
  Then once everything is correctly described, we can then create a tiday data set using the aggregate function and the data set that
  was created from the merge before. The new dataset has the average measures for each subject and activity type and is labeled as 
  "clean_samsung_data.txt"
